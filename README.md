This is a new [**React Native**](https://reactnative.dev) project, bootstrapped using [`@react-native-community/cli`](https://github.com/react-native-community/cli).

# Getting Started

>**Note**: Make sure you have completed the [React Native - Environment Setup](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) instructions till "Creating a new application" step, before proceeding.

## Step 1: Start the Metro Server

First, you will need to start **Metro**, the JavaScript _bundler_ that ships _with_ React Native.

To start Metro, run the following command from the _root_ of your React Native project:

```bash
# using npm
npm start
```

## Step 2: Start your Application

Let Metro Bundler run in its _own_ terminal. Open a _new_ terminal from the _root_ of your React Native project. Run the following command to start your _Android_ or _iOS_ app:

### For Android

```bash
# using npm
npm run android

# OR using Yarn
yarn android
```

### For iOS

```bash
# using npm
npm run ios

# OR using Yarn
yarn ios
```

### Yaku Project
The Yaku project is a platform developed by Louis Yang, Louis Lefevbre, Thomas Lamiable, and Johan Bognon, similar to Yoka. It aims to provide users with a comprehensive solution for tracking their dietary intake, accessing nutritional information, and discovering new food products.

### Used API
To retrieve information about food products, we utilize the OpenFoodTracks API. This API grants us access to a vast database containing detailed information about food products, including their nutritional composition, ingredients, labels, and nutritional values.

### Key Features
- Search for food products by name, brand, or category.
- Display detailed nutritional information for each product.
- Track daily and historical dietary intake.
- Receive suggestions for similar or alternative products.
- Create shopping lists and track food purchases.
- Technologies Used

 - The Yaku project is primarily developed using modern web technologies such as React Native.
